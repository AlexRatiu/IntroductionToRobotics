# IntroductionToRobotics 2023-2024
Step into the exciting world of robotics through 3rd-year assignments at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework package includes precise requirements, implementation insights, code, and image files. Let's embark on this robotic journey together! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

## Homework1  

### Task Requirements
In this assignment, I learned how to control an RGB LED using individual potentiometers with my Arduino. By the end of this task, I gained hands-on experience in interfacing potentiometers with my Arduino and using analog readings to control the RGB LED's colors.

## Homework2  
### Task Requirements
In this task, you will gain hands-on experience in simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with an Arduino. Throughout this assignment, you will learn how to manage button state changes, apply debouncing techniques, and effectively coordinate multiple components to create a representation of real-world scenarios.

## Homework3
### Task Requirements
In this project, you will utilize a joystick as a control input to manipulate the position of a segment, effectively allowing you to 'draw' on a display. The segment's movements should feel natural, with the ability to transition only to neighboring positions, while avoiding any passage through 'walls.' The initial segment position will be set on the decimal point (DP). The current position will always blink, regardless of the segment's on/off state. Using the joystick, you can shift the segment to adjacent positions, following a designated movement table. A short press of the button toggles the segment state between ON and OFF, while a long press of the button resets the entire display by turning off all segments and relocating the current position to the decimal point.
