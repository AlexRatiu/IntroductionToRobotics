# IntroductionToRobotics 2023-2024
Step into the exciting world of robotics through 3rd-year assignments at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework package includes precise requirements, implementation insights, code, and image files. Let's embark on this robotic journey together! üöÄü§ñüîß

## Homework1  

### Task Requirements
In this assignment, I learned how to control an RGB LED using individual potentiometers with my Arduino. By the end of this task, I gained hands-on experience in interfacing potentiometers with my Arduino and using analog readings to control the RGB LED's colors.

## Homework2  
### Task Requirements
In this task, I gained valuable hands-on experience simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with my Arduino. Throughout this assignment, I learned how to manage button state changes, implement debouncing techniques, and skillfully coordinate multiple components to create a realistic representation of real-world scenarios. This immersive project provided insights into the complexities of system coordination and enhanced my proficiency in Arduino-based simulations.

## Homework3
### Task Requirements
In this project, I harnessed the power of a joystick to manipulate a segment's position, creating a dynamic 'drawing' experience on a display. The segment moves naturally, transitioning only to adjacent positions and avoiding 'walls.' The initial segment blinks on the decimal point, indicating the current position. With the joystick, I could smoothly shift the segment, following a designated movement table. A short button press toggles the segment state, while a long press resets the display, turning off all segments and relocating the current position to the decimal point. This project provided a hands-on exploration of joystick control and interactive display dynamics.

## Homework4

### Task Requirements
In this project, I designed a stopwatch timer using a 4-digit 7-segment display and three buttons. The timer counts in 10ths of a second and includes a lap function similar to common phone stopwatches. This hands-on endeavor enhanced my skills in microcontroller-based timing systems, memory management, and user interface design. Dive into this practical exploration of Arduino's capabilities in creating an interactive and versatile stopwatch timer.

## Homework5

### Task Requirements
In this assignment, I mastered the art of developing a "Smart Environment Monitor and Logger" with Arduino. Throughout the task, I honed my skills in integrating various sensors, managing EEPROM for data storage, and implementing a user-friendly Serial Menu. This project showcases my proficiency in sensor readings, memory management, and Serial Communication, contributing to the creation of an intelligent environmental monitoring solution. üåêüõ†Ô∏è

## Homework6

### Task Requirements

I am tasked with developing a small game on an 8x8 matrix. The game should feature a minimum of three types of elements: the player (blinking slowly), bombs/bullets (blinking fast), and walls (which don't blink). The goal is to provide a starting point for a matrix project. The basic idea involves generating walls on the map, covering 50% to 75% of the matrix, and then maneuvering the player to destroy them. The gameplay can follow a Bomberman style, terminator-tanks style, or any other creative approach. This project is designed to kickstart your exploration of matrix-based games.
