# IntroductionToRobotics
Step into the exciting world of robotics through 3rd-year assignments at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework package includes precise requirements, implementation insights, code, and image files. Let's embark on this robotic journey together! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

## Homework1  
### Task Requirements
In this assignment, I learned how to control an RGB LED using individual potentiometers with my Arduino. By the end of this task, I gained hands-on experience in interfacing potentiometers with my Arduino and using analog readings to control the RGB LED's colors.
