## Homework3
### Task Requirements
In this project, I harnessed the power of a joystick to manipulate a segment's position, creating a dynamic 'drawing' experience on a display. The segment moves naturally, transitioning only to adjacent positions and avoiding 'walls.' The initial segment blinks on the decimal point, indicating the current position. With the joystick, I could smoothly shift the segment, following a designated movement table. A short button press toggles the segment state, while a long press resets the display, turning off all segments and relocating the current position to the decimal point. This project provided a hands-on exploration of joystick control and interactive display dynamics.

## Homework4

### Task Requirements
In this project, I designed a stopwatch timer using a 4-digit 7-segment display and three buttons. The timer counts in 10ths of a second and includes a lap function similar to common phone stopwatches. This hands-on endeavor enhanced my skills in microcontroller-based timing systems, memory management, and user interface design. Dive into this practical exploration of Arduino's capabilities in creating an interactive and versatile stopwatch timer.

## Homework6

### Task Requirements

I am tasked with developing a small game on an 8x8 matrix. The game should feature a minimum of three types of elements: the player (blinking slowly), bombs/bullets (blinking fast), and walls (which don't blink). The goal is to provide a starting point for a matrix project. The basic idea involves generating walls on the map, covering 50% to 75% of the matrix, and then maneuvering the player to destroy them. The gameplay can follow a Bomberman style, terminator-tanks style, or any other creative approach. This project is designed to kickstart your exploration of matrix-based games.

## Snake Game for Arduino
### Introduction
  As a child, I find myself reminiscing about the delightful days spent immersed in the captivating world of gaming. One particular memory that stands out in my mind is the joyous hours I spent playing the classic Snake game on my trusty Nokia phone. The sheer simplicity of the game, coupled with its irresistibly addictive gameplay, captivated my young imagination. </br>

  The challenge of maneuvering the ever-growing snake across the screen, all while avoiding collisions with its own tail, presented a thrilling and engaging experience. These childhood memories have etched themselves into my consciousness, creating a sense of nostalgia that has persisted over the years. </br>

  Fueled by the desire to pay homage to those cherished moments, I embarked on a creative journey to bring the essence of the Snake game to life in a new and exciting form. Drawing inspiration from the past, I decided to channel my enthusiasm into recreating the Snake game using an Arduino platform. Armed with an 8x8 LED matrix, a joystick, a buzzer, and an assortment of other components, I set out to craft a tangible and interactive homage to this iconic game. </br>

  The process of translating the digital magic of Snake into a physical, Arduino-based incarnation was both challenging and rewarding. Each component played a crucial role in recreating the gameplay experience I held dear from my childhood. The 8x8 LED matrix served as the canvas upon which the snake would slither and grow, while the joystick provided a tactile and responsive means of control. The inclusion of a buzzer added an auditory dimension, enhancing the overall immersive experience. </br>

  As I delved into the intricacies of coding and circuitry, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment with each successful step in the project. The nostalgia-driven motivation behind this endeavor fueled my determination to capture the essence of the classic Snake game while introducing a novel and hands-on element. </br>

  In the end, my Arduino-based Snake game became not just a technological project, but a tangible manifestation of childhood memories and a testament to the enduring appeal of simple yet captivating gameplay. It stands as a tribute to the games that shaped my early years and a reminder of the power that nostalgia holds in inspiring creativity and innovation. </br>

### Game Description
In this faithful recreation of the classic, the Arduino Snake game masterfully revives the timeless charm. With a joystick in hand, players expertly navigate a snake through a grid, savoring apples to extend its length while deftly avoiding collisions. The 8x8 LED matrix vividly displays the game elements, immersing players in a pixelated world of nostalgia. Meanwhile, a buzzer introduces delightful sound effects, creating a symphony of retro joy in this thoughtfully crafted and triple-layered experience that seamlessly blends the old and the new.

### Instructions
1)Use the joystick to navigate the snake: push up, down, left, or right. </br> 
2)Eat apples to increase your score and the length of the snake. </br> 
3)Be cautious not to collide with the snake's body, as it will end the game. </br> 
4)The game speed increases as your score grows, adding an extra layer of challenge. </br> 

### Used Components
Arduino Uno </br> 
8x8 LED Matrix </br> 
Joystick </br> 
Buzzer </br> 
Potetiometer </br>
Breadboard </br> 

### Code Overview
The Arduino code utilizes the LedControl library for interfacing with the LED matrix, along with a LiquidCrystal display for additional information. The game logic is implemented using structs for the snake and apple, and the joystick and button inputs are handled for player control. The code also incorporates EEPROM for saving and retrieving brightness and sound settings.
